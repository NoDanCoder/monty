## The Monty language

Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty
byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific
instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an
interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

### Monty byte code files

Files containing Monty byte codes usually have the *.m* extension. Most of
the industry uses this standard but it is not required by the specification
of the language. There is not more than one instruction per line. There can be
any number of spaces before or after the opcode and its argument:

```
**vagrant >** cat -e bytecodes/000.m
push 0$
push 1$
push 2$
  push 3$
                   pall    $
push 4$
    push 5    $
      push    6        $
pall$
**vagrant >**
```

Monty byte code files can contain blank lines (empty or made of spaces only,
and any additional text after the opcode or its required argument is not taken into account:

```
**vagrant >** cat -e bytecodes/001.m
push 0 Push 0 onto the stack$
push 1 Push 1 onto the stack$
$
push 2$
  push 3$
                   pall    $
$
$
                           $
push 4$
$
    push 5    $
      push    6        $
$
pall This is the end of our program. Monty is awesome!$

### The monty program

 + Usage: **monty file**
   - where **file** is the path to the file containing Monty byte code
 + If the user does not give any file or more than one argument to your program,
print the error message **USAGE: monty file**, followed by a new line, and exit with the
status **EXIT_FAILURE**
 + If, for any reason, itâ€™s not possible to open the file, print the error message **Error: Can't
open file <file>**, followed by a new line, and exit with the status **EXIT_FAILURE**
   - where **<file>** is the name of the file
